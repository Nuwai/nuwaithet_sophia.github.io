# Hi, I'm **Nu Wai Thet (Sophia)** 👋  
**Data Analyst | ML Engineer | NLP for Burmese Language**

I’m passionate about applying **Machine Learning, NLP, and Data Analytics** to solve real-world problems, especially in **low-resource language contexts** like Myanmar.  
My focus areas include:

- 🧠 **AI for Social Good** (Women in Politics, Scam Detection)
- 📊 **Data Analytics & Visualization**
- 🗣️ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- ⚙️ **Automation & Deployment**

🎓 M.Sc. in Electronics Engineering (NTU Singapore)
